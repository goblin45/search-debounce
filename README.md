## Debounced search

This is a react search component I built that will help you and me in integrating search functionality in our future projects in less time. 
The `./src/components/Search.jsx` contains Longest Common Subsequence alorithm which results in displaying search recommendations based on current string value in the search input field.

You can customize the component and the CSS as you wish when you integrate this with you project.

If the component helps, you can follow me. 
Happy coding!!
